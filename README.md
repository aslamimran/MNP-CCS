# Contamination Control Scorecard (CCS) for Micro- and Nanoplastics Research

This repository provides the Contamination Control Scorecard (CCS), a practical framework for assessing contamination control and QA/QC practices in micro- and nanoplastics (MNP) analytical workflows.

The CCS is designed as a **diagnostic and interpretive tool**, not as a compliance checklist or ranking system. It supports transparent reporting, self-assessment, and cross-study comparison of contamination control strategies.

## Contents
- `MNP-CCS1.0_scorecard_with_formulas.xlsx`  
  Executable spreadsheet template with:
  - Indicator-level scoring
  - Weighted aggregation
  - Automatic calculation of PCS, TS, and final CCS score

- `README.md`  
  Documentation and guidance for use.

## Framework overview
The CCS evaluates contamination control across:
- Laboratory environment
- Consumables and equipment
- Reagents and solvents
- Blank and recovery controls
- Personnel practices
- Transparency and reporting

Scores are normalized, weighted, and combined into:
- **PCS**: Process Control Score  
- **TS**: Transparency Score  
- **CCS**: Final composite score (1–100)

## Intended use
- Self-assessment of laboratory workflows
- Transparent reporting in supplementary information
- Method development and optimization
- Educational and interlaboratory discussions

The CCS does not define minimum acceptance thresholds and should be interpreted in context.
