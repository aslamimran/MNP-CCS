How to use the CCS 1.0 scorecard

Enter raw scores only in the Raw score column using the dropdown menus.
Do not edit formulas or weights.

Raw scores must reflect practices actually implemented and documented in the study or laboratory workflow.

Scores are automatically:

Normalized by indicator-specific maximum values

Weighted according to contamination risk

Aggregated into domain scores, PCS, TS, and final CCS

The CCS is a diagnostic and interpretive tool intended to highlight strengths and gaps in contamination control.
It is not a compliance checklist, acceptance threshold, or ranking system.

Scores should be interpreted in context, alongside blank data, recovery controls, and analytical limitations.

That’s it. No more.
